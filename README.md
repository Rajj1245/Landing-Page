This project is a simple landing page for a digital trucking platform named Chinkara. It is built using HTML and CSS and focuses on practicing Flexbox layout design. The webpage includes a header section with a logo and navigation links, a hero section describing India’s largest digital trucking platform with a sign-up button and image, a section showcasing available trucks with their payload and freight details, a motivational quote section, a call-to-action banner, and a footer. The layout is structured using Flexbox with proper alignment, spacing, and styling. This project helps in understanding page structure, responsive alignment, image handling, and button styling using CSS.
